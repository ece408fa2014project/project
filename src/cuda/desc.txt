Canny Edge Detection System

Involves 4 kernels.

1. simple convolution kernel
    Identical to convolution we did in the previous lab. filter used was this:
        2   4    5    4    2
        4   9    12   9    4  \   /
        5   12   15   12   5   \ /     1/
        4   9    12   9    4   / \     / 115
        2   4    5    4    2  /   \

2. Gradient calculator
    Simple convolutions but with different filters
    Gx filter:
        -1 0 +1
        -2 0 +2
        -1 0 +1

    Gy filter:
        +1 +2 +1
        0  0  0
        -1 -2 -1
    
    Value that goes into cell is |G| = |Gx| + |Gy|

3. theta calculator
    In each cell, theta = InvTan(Gy/Gx)
    This gives us (very roughly) the "angle" of the point we're looking at.

4. Direction normalizer
    Locks direction to one of 4 directions:
        0 degrees
        45 degrees
        90 degrees
        135 degrees

5. line tracer (NON-CUDA)
    If a point is in the same "direction" as the points around it, fill it in. Otherwise, don't.
        Tolerance: 1 step difference (i.e. 45 degrees to 90, 135 to 0, etc.)
